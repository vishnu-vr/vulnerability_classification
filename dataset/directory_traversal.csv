						pacman prior to version 5.1.3 is affected by: Directory Traversal. The impact is: arbitrary file placement potentially leading to arbitrary root code execution. The component is: installing a remote package via a specified URL ""pacman -U <url>"". The problem was located in function curl_download_internal in lib/libalpm/dload.c line 535. The attack vector is: the victim must install a remote package via a specified URL from a malicious server (or a network MitM if downloading over HTTP). The fixed version is: 5.1.3 via commit 9702703633bec2c007730006de2aeec8587dfc84.					"

						An issue was discovered in GetSimple CMS through 3.3.15. insufficient input sanitation in the theme-edit.php file allows upload of files with arbitrary content (PHP code, for example). This vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user; however, authentication can be bypassed. According to the official documentation for installation step 10, an admin is required to upload all the files, including the .htaccess files, and run a health check. However, what is overlooked is that the Apache HTTP Server by default no longer enables the AllowOverride directive, leading to data/users/admin.xml password exposure. The passwords are hashed but this can be bypassed by starting with the data/other/authorization.xml API key. This allows one to target the session state, since they decided to roll their own implementation. The cookie_name is crafted information that can be leaked from the frontend (site name and version). If a someone leaks the API key and the admin username, then they can bypass authentication. To do so, they need to supply a cookie based on an SHA-1 computation of this known information. The vulnerability exists in the admin/theme-edit.php file. This file checks for forms submissions via POST requests, and for the csrf nonce. If the nonce sent is correct, then the file provided by the user is uploaded. There is a path traversal allowing write access outside the jailed themes directory root. Exploiting the traversal is not necessary because the .htaccess file is ignored. A contributing factor is that there isn't another check on the extension before saving the file, with the assumption that the parameter content is safe. This allows the creation of web accessible and executable files with arbitrary content.					"

						A Directory Traversal vulnerability in the web framework code of the Cisco application-hosting framework (CAF) component of the Cisco IOx application environment could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read any file from the CAF in the virtual instance running on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted requests to the CAF web interface. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx. Cisco IOx Releases 1.0.0.0 and 1.1.0.0 are vulnerable.

						A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the Cloud Foundry component Cloud Controller that affects cf-release versions prior to v208 and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime versions prior to 1.4.2. Path traversal is the 'outbreak' of a given directory structure through relative file paths in the user input. It aims at accessing files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder, for disallowed reading or even executing arbitrary system commands. An attacker could use a certain parameter of the file path for instance to inject '../' sequences in order to navigate through the file system. In this particular case a remote authenticated attacker can exploit the identified vulnerability in order to upload arbitrary files to the server running a Cloud Controller instance - outside the isolated application container.

						The Grails Resource Plugin often has to exchange URIs for resources with other internal components. Those other components will decode any URI passed to them. To protect against directory traversal the Grails Resource Plugin did the following: normalized the URI, checked the normalized URI did not step outside the appropriate root directory (e.g. the web application root), decoded the URI and checked that this did not introduce additional /../ (and similar) sequences. A bug was introduced where the Grails Resource Plugin before 1.2.13 returned the decoded version of the URI rather than the normalized version of the URI after the directory traversal check. This exposed a double decoding vulnerability. To address this issue, the Grails Resource Plugin now repeatedly decodes the URI up to three times or until decoding no longer changes the URI. If the decode limit of 3 is exceeded the URI is rejected. A side-effect of this is that the Grails Resource Plugin is unable to serve a resource that includes a '%' character in the full path to the resource. Not all environments are vulnerable because of the differences in URL resolving in different servlet containers. Applications deployed to Tomcat 8 and Jetty 9 were found not not be vulnerable, however applications deployed to JBoss EAP 6.3 / JBoss AS 7.4 and JBoss AS 7.1 were found to be vulnerable (other JBoss versions weren't tested). In certain cases JBoss returns JBoss specific vfs protocol urls from URL resolution methods (ClassLoader.getResources). The JBoss vfs URL protocol supports resolving any file on the filesystem. This made the directory traversal possible. There may be other containers, in addition to JBoss, on which this vulnerability is exposed.					"
